## Info
**Date:** Spring 2023  
**Class:** DES 330 (Narrative Design 2)  
**Where:** DigiPen Institute of Technology  

This mini project was worked on over the course of about 1/3 of a semester. 

## Goal
Pitch a cutscene for a game of your making, then write said cutscene in the Hollywood Standard script format.

## Results
You can find the final documents located in the folder with this file.  

The game in which this cutscene takes place is a horror puzzle game where a doll gains sentience to investigate what is corrupting her home.  

In the cutscene the player learns that a reoccuring character in the game is actually the Spirit of the Dollhouse. The player is too late to do anything with this revelation as this character dies shortly after the fact.  

This scene is a transition into the last stage of the game where the player must escape with their life as their home is being destroyed for good.  

## Process
When brewing up the concept for this scene I wanted to combine two things I very much enjoy: horror games and the Style Savvy game series.  

While playing through Style Savvy: Fashion Forward for inspiration, I noticed the dollhouse and miniatures and thought that would pair nicely with a horror concept. Dolls have been used in horror concepts time and time again.  
I figured I could take this classic pairing and put my own spin on it.  

As for this particular cutscene I wanted to capture a pivotal moment in the story. I wanted to focus on emotion and interpersonal relations.  
This scene would take place during/near the turn of the game so it had to have a big impact. I felt like revealing the true identity of a character close to the main character would be perfect for this.  

How would you feel if the person/thing you've been trying to save this entire time died and there was nothing you could do about it? What does it feel like to have everything crumble around you in real time?  

These were some of the questions I kept in mind while writing this cutscene.
After many iterrations, I ended up with the concept you are able to see today.

## What I Would do Differently
On this project I would also like to work more on character voice.  

I think the two characters in this scene speak too similarly and would like to showcase their individual personalities through their dialogue more. 

## What I Learned
I learned how to write in the Hollywood Script format.  
With that I learned about how to use camera, environment, color, and audio to **show not tell**.  

When writing scripts you have to keep in mind the final format that the project will take shape. It is a mainly visual medium (vs written), so it is important to take into account all the visual cues that can be used to build emotion and story.
