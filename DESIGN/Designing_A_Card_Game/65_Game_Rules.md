# 65 Card Game
## Info 
**Date:** Fall 2020  
**Class:** DES 115 (Intro Design)  
**Where:** DigiPen Institute of Technology

The first game I designed!

## Goal
Design a card game that uses a standard deck of cards and can be played with 2 - 4 players.

## Process

### Inspiration - Where to Start?
I will be honest, when I designed this, I had not played a lot of card games before.   
So I decided to base the game on a concept from Pyramid Solitaire (creating pairs that add to 13) and go from there.  
From there I started ironing out the basic details (rules structure, win condition, etc.) while iterating on the main mechanic.  

### Biggest Obstacle in the Iteration Process?
After version 1.0 of the game was created and the testing process began, I encountered my biggest obstacle - **readability.**  

The first iteration of the rules were not read friendly, leading to playtesters skip over important rules and not play the game correctly. If they are not playing the game correctly, I cannot accurately assess if my testing goals are being met or not.  

Thus, the process of adding visual variety started. As you can see in the final version of this project I used a mix of formatting (structural and word) and color to make sure the rules were not a wall of text.  
In addition to this, I made sure to continue to edit the contents of the rules to be encompassing, but also concise. 

This resulted in a lot more playtesters understanding the rules and not skipping over vital information. An added bonus from the formatting was that players were able to quickly find information if they needed a refresher on a particular rule.
## What I Would do Differently
Below are two things I would try differently if I were to redesign this project today.

### Visual Clarity
This related back to the biggest obstacle mentioned previously, I think the clarity of the rules could be continued to be worked on.  
The formatting used could be more cohesive to indicate to the reader that a particular highlighting relates to specific information. (An example of what that means: only bolding keywords, all actions are in green, etc.)  
Images could be used as well to concisely convey some of the concepts to cut down on words aswell. 
### More Exciting Design
Looking back at the design of this game, it is quite simple and I think it could use another mechanic or twist to spice up the gameplay. As the game stands, there is nothing in particular about the design that sticks in your brain. If you were to put this game in a line up with similar games, it would be hard to pick it out.  

I think a mechanic that makes the players engage with each other more would be an ideal add to this game. Perhaps making a special pair allows you to swap hands with a different player? Or even swap the hands of your oppoenents?  


## What did I Learn from this Project
I think an important concept I learned from this (besides that card games are not so easy to design ha) is that **the majority of the time players are not going to interact with your design as you intent.**  

When I wrote the first version of the rules, I thought everything was written completely clear and there was no way that a player wouldn't be able to understand what I was trying to teach them. I quickly learned that wasn't the case. This is because the players had none of the context that I had.  

For me, the rules made sense since I knew what I was trying to achieve with them. The players did not know any of that. Adding in context and better wording to the rules helped push the players to play the game the way I added.  

With the context, it was also important to answer questions initially forgotten. For example: what to do when the draw pile is emptied? The design has to account for as many possibilities as is reasonably possible.
