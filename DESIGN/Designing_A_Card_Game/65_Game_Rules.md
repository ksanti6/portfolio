# 65 Card Game
## Info 
Date: Fall 2020  
Class: DES 115 (Intro Design)  
The first game I designed!

## Goal
Design a card game that uses a standard deck of cards and can be played with 2 - 4 players.

## Process / Results
### Inspiration - Where to Start?
I will be honest, when I designed this, I had not played a lot of card games before.   
So I decided to base the game on a concept from Pyramid Solitaire (creating pairs that add to 13) and go from there.  
From there I started ironing out the basic details (rules structure, win condition, etc.) while iterating on the main mechanic.  

### Biggest Obstacle in the Iteration Process?
After version 1.0 of the game was created and the testing process began, I encountered my biggest obstacle - **readability.**  
The first iteration of the rules were not read friendly, leading to playtesters skip over important rules and not play the game correctly. If they are not playing the game correctly, I cannot accurately assess if my testing goals are being met or not.  
Thus, the process of adding visual variety started. As you can see in the final version of this project I used a mix of formatting (structural and word) and color to make sure the rules were not a wall of text. 


## What I Would do Differently
Below are two things I would try differently if I were to redesign this project today.

### Visual Clarity

### More Exciting Design
