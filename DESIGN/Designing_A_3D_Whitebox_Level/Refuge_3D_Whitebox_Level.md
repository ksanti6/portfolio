## Info
**Date:** Fall 2021  
**Class:** DES 214 (technical level design)  
**Where:** DigiPen Institute of Technology

Made in Unity.  
This project was made in half a semester.

## Goal
Create 3D whitebox level with a Setup, Hook, Development, Turn, and Resolution. Include multiple forms of guidance.

## Results
View at the start of the level entering the maze. The player is standing in a hole in a fence looking at a lamp post with a green light.

View from a height looking down at the maze. The player is standing on a ledge and can see the house they came from in the distance.

View from the top of the "hill" the player gets teleported to. The player is looking out at "hills" and "pillars".

View entering the village at the end of the level. The player is looking at a big house in the distance with tall "pillars" lining a path towards the house.

## Process
### Setup / Hook / Development / Turn / Resolution
This is the intended flow of the level.  
**Setup**  
The player starts in a burning house. Turning around they are able to exit the house towards the backyard. The player can explore the backyard that is fenced in.  

**Hook**  
The player notices a hole in the fence that they can fit through. Through this hole the player can see a green light in the distance. Moving towards the light through the hole the player enters a maze.  

**Development**  
The player starts to explore forward through the maze and eventually up a giant wall in the distance. At the top of the wall the player can look out and notice that the entire area is trapped in some sort of box. The player can escape this by jumping off the wall into the unknown.  

The player lands in a brightly lit hillside. Exploring through the hillside the player sees indications of ruins but nothing too intact to make anything of it.  

**Turn**  
Following the path through the valley of trees the player finds an entire village. It is empty, but safe.  

**Resolution**  
The player enters the biggest house in the center of the village. Despite being in a foreign area, they are safer than they were in the familiar house they started in.  

**So What Does it Mean?**  
The intention for this level was for the player to leave their familiar but unsafe house to go on an adventure. During this adventure the player would have to experience confusing times (the maze) and have to take a leap of faith to finally find peace/safety.  

I wanted a dramatic shift in lighting (super dark area to bright and sunny) to indicate the player was finally on the right path to safety. The hillside is turbulent, but no where near the level of the maze. Then at last the player finds this desolate village, which traditionally doesn't seem like it would be a safe place. Its run down and abandoned, but its safer than the burning house the player started in.

### Guidance
In this project I used many forms of guidance. The main ones used were:
- lighting
- pathes
- lines  

I used the lighting of the lamps in the maze to indicate that the player was on the correct path. Green lights were good, red lights were bad.  
Pathes can be found mostly in the second half of the level to guide the player through the trees.  
Lines were also used in the second half of the level. The broken pillars pointed in the direction the player should go. 

## What I Would do Differently
There are a lot of things I would change about this project and I actually did a rework of it recently. You can see what I did differently from following the link to the new version in the links section below.  

## What I Learned
I learned a lot about whiteboxing and the importance of having your objects accurately look like what they are supposed to represent. This was something I clearly struggled with as my pillars looked more like barbells than pillars and it really confused my players.  
I also learned the importance of guidance.
