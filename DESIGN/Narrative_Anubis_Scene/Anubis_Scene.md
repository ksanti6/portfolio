## Info
**Date:** Fall 2022  
**Class:** DES 230 (Narrative Design 1)  
**Where:** DigiPen Institute of Technology  

This mini project was made over two assignments in my Intro Narrative class.  
In the documents you will see an addition story brief and scene written. While those will not be discussed in this write-up, I elected to keep them in the documents to showcase more of my writing.

## Goal
Write a story brief following class guidelines and then from that brief write a scene. Scene should have choices for the player to make that impact the result of the scene.
## Results
You can find the final documents located in the folder with this file.  

The scene I wrote about was an organ donation gone wrong and dealing with the aftermath of that before the Egyptian God of Death, Anubis.  
Two former lovers have claim to the same heart upon death, but only one of them can be judged and enter the afterlife with that heart.
## Process

I was looking at various mythologies for inspiration when I eventually stumbled upon Anubis and how he judges the dead who want to enter the afterlife.   
After discussing said mythology with a friend, we had found a question that we didn't have an answer for: **How do people who have a heart transplant get judged by Anubis?**  
Thinking about it, I knew that this would be a great scenario to write about and thus it became the first scene brief I made.  
Of course I had to up the stakes, what if the two people who are now associated with the heart had previous ties together? How would that impact the scenario (and their relationship) now that they are in the afterlife? 

## What I Would do Differently
I think I would like to itterate on the character lines in the scene more. Having strong character voice isn't easy to get right on the first try. 
## What I Learned
How to describe a scene in a compact and efficient manner. There's an art to making the perfect bite sized scene that gets across important information/choices to the player while also not dragging on too long. I still have a lot to learn in that art, but I certained leveled up my skills with this mini project.
