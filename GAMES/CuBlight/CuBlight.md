## Info
**Date:** Fall 2022 - Spring 2023  
**Class:** GAM 300/350 (junior game project class)  
**Where:** DigiPen Institute of Technology  

**This document is an overview of my contributions to this project.**  

Check out the trailer of the game, linked at the bottom.  

**Team Composition:**  
**Total Members:** 10 (including me!)  
**Disciplines on team:** Audio, Design, Programming  
**My Primary Roles:** Producer, Audio/Gameplay Programmer

## Game Concept
Cu Blight is a fast-paced action roguelike isometric twin-stick shooter. Move, shoot, and dash your way through randomly selected rooms, gaining items along the way, with the goal of destroying everything that isn't the perfect shape (a cube).  

## Work in Each Role
### Production
As Producer some of the tasks I was in charge of were:  
- lead efficient all discipline meetings
- used Trello to track progress towards milestones
- delivered milestone presentations to professors

### Programming
These are the tasks I was in charge of during development.  

**Audio**  
It was my job to integrate Wwise with spatial audio into Unity and manage all the audio events for background music and sound effects.  
I continuely communicated with our Sound Designer to keep him in the loop about what sound effects the game needed and ensure I implemented the audio in the way he intended.  

**Items**  
The other main system I worked on dealt with the items. I implemented how the player gains items.  
The player kills enemies and gains EXP. Once their EXP bar is full, they receive a pop up that allows them to choose between 2 items/upgrades.  
I worked on the logic behind this and the UI involved with it.  

**Input**  
I worked on the games seamless swapping between the two input sources: mouse/keyboard and controller.  
I used the Unity Input System to capture the inputs from each source and then wrote a script that detected which was last used and use that for the game. The player is able to switch which source they want to use mid game with ease.

## What I Learned
I solidified my skills in Unity from working on this project.  
I learned about Unity's Input System and how Unity interacts with Wwise.  

I learned a lot about being a team leader and what it takes to hit and surpass milestones without crunch. Communication between different disciplines is king.
